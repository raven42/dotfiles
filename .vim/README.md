# Basic usage
Basic usage and navigation uses the standard vim movement keys and also uses the mouse to move between windows, select text in visual mode, and move the cursor. There are also some useful key mappings to move between windows. This vim configuration is optimized for 175 character wide screens or more using the DevPanel plugin will yield about 120 characters in the active edit window.

### Key Shortcuts
```
<Ctrl-Up>    - Move to the window above the current one.
<Ctrl-Down>  - Move to the window below the current one.
<Ctrl-Left>  - Move to the window to the left of the current one.
<Ctrl-Right> - Move to the window to the right of the current one.
<Leader><#>  - Move to the open buffer as signified by `#`. (Example: `\2`)
<Leader>n    - Move to the next buffer
<Leader>p    - Move to the previous buffer
<Leader>cc   - Toggle a comment block around the currently selected code in visual mode.
<Leader>cm   - Comment a block of code using minimal comments
<Leader>ci   - Invert selected code: Comment any uncommented code, and uncomment any commented code
<Leader>cy   - Yank selected code into clipboard and then comment out
<Leader>-    - Resize the current window making it 5 characters less in height
<Leader>=    - Resize the current window making it 5 characters more in height
<Leader>_    - Resize the current window making it 5 character less in width
<Leader>+    - Resize the current window making it 5 character more in width
<Leader>q    - Close the current buffer
<Leader>d    - Toggle the DevPanel showing the File Explorer, Tag, and if needed the Python Syntax Checker panels
<Leader>x    - Toggle the File Explorer panel
<Leader>t    - Toggle the Tag panel
<Leader>u    - Toggle the undo history panel
<Leader>vv   - Grep for the word under the cursor, match all occurences
<Leader>va   - Like vv, but add to existing list
<Leader>vr   - Perform a global search on the word under the cursor and prompt for a pattern with which to replace it.
```
:information\_source: **Leader:** All these `<Leader>` commands are done using the `\` key by default. Example `\1` will jump to the first open buffer. This can be changed in your .vimrc if you wish to use a different `<Leader>` character by adding a `:let mapleader = "<character>"`.

### Folding Shortcuts
```

## Vim Folding
There are numerous folding methods pre-defined in this .vimrc implementation. These methods allow you to view files and move around in the file a lot easier. It can allow you to limit the information you see on the screen to only what you care about. The various methods are described here.

#### SEARCH Folding
The `search` folding method can be used in two ways. Either by a `<Leader>zs` (z-search) or `<Leader>zw` (z-word) shortcut. The difference is the z-word short cut will search for the vim word under the cursor, and then perform the `search` fold method. The z-search method simply performs the `search` fold method on whatever the current search pattern is.

There is alto the `invert-search` folding method using the `<Leader>zis` which will do the opposite and set the fold level dependent on lines not containing the search pattern.

![search-folding example](../img/search\_folding.png?raw=true "Search Fold Example:")

#### GIT Folding
The `git` folding method can be used with the `<Leader>zg` (z-git) shortcut to view the current git hunks that have been modified in a file. This can be useful for previewing all the changes in your file before you stage it. Only unstaged changes will be shown.

![git-folding example](../img/git\_folding.png?raw=true "Git Fold Example:")

#### Syntax Folding
The `syntax` folding method can be used with the `<Leader>zy` (z-syntax) shortcut to view the file in recognized syntax blocks. This can be useful to fold away all functions for example and expand the entire function only as needed. This also works on known blocks within the function such as `if` statements, and `switch` statements.

![syntax-folding example](../img/syntax\_folding.png?raw=true "Syntax Fold Example:")

#### Indent Folding
The `indent` folding methods is very similar to the `syntax` folding method and is activated with `<Leader>zi` (z-indent). The indent method is quicker to process and operates strictly based on indentation blocks. This is useful for filetypes which don't have a known syntax. If you are working on a filetype which does have a known syntax, then the `syntax` folding method will probably be more beneficial.

![indent-folding example](../img/indent\_folding.png?raw=true "Indent Fold Example:")

#### DIFF Folding
The `diff` folding method can be used with the `<Leader>zd` (z-diff) shortcut. This can be used when looking at `diff <file1> <file2>` output, or from the output of `git diff`. It can limit the view to show only the files (level 1), or the files and line numbers where changes occurred (level 2), or everything (level 3).

![diff-folding example](../img/diff\_folding.png?raw=true "Diff Fold Example:")

#### LOG Folding
The `log` folding method can be used with `<Leader>zl` (z-log). This can be used when examining `.log` files. It keys off the log level to determine what to show at what level. When the log level is set to any of the recognized levels, all logs of that level or higher will be shown. The recognized levels are based on these strings when found in the log message:

```
[VERBOSE]  - Fold Level 9
[DEBUG]    - Fold Level 8
[INFO]     - Fold Level 7
[NOTICE]   - Fold Level 6
[WARN]     - Fold Level 5 (default)
[ERR]      - Fold Level 4
[CRIT]     - Fold Level 3
[ALERT]    - Fold Level 2
[EMERG]    - Fold Level 1
###        - Fold Level 0 (comment lines)
```

![log-folding example](../img/log\_folding.png?raw=true "Log Fold Example:")

#### DEFINE Folding
The `define` folding method is used with the `#if` and `#endif` preprocessor directives in a file. It will increase the fold level everytime a `#if` is found, and decrease the fold level everytime a `#endif` is found. This will allow for nested definitions to work at different levels.

![define-folding_example](../img/define_folding.png?raw=true "Define Fold Example:")

#### CHEATSHEET Folding
The `cheatsheet` folding method can be used when viewing a document with the `.cheat` extension. This is activated with the `<Leader>zC` (z-cheatsheet) shortcut. The format of this `.cheat` file is setup to define `HEADER` blocks denoted by lines starting with 5 hash marks `#####`. The `HEADER` sections are all defined as level 1 with fold markers starting at the beginning of that header, and ending when the next header block is found. Closing the fold at a `HEADER` will fold away all `SECTIONS` and `UNUSED` blocks within that header block.

The `SECTION` blocks are denoted by lines starting with 3 hash marks `###`, and can be used to separate out individual sections in that are unique and indepenent, but still categorized under the same `HEADER`. These are all set to fold level 2.

Lastly `UNUSED` blocks which are denoted by lines starting with 3 hyphens `---` can be defined for sections which are less used and you might wish to hide. These are all set to fold level 3. For example, if you set your fold level to 2, then you will see all `HEADER` blocks, all `SECTION` blocks, but only see the `UNUSED` titles but not content.

![cheatsheet-folding example](../img/cheatsheet\_folding.png?raw=true "Cheatsheet Fold Example:")

---

## DevPanel
The DevPanel plugin will automatically open the NERDTree and Tagbar plugin windows and arrange them accordingly.
![devpanel vim example](../img/devpanel\_example.png?raw=true "DevPanel Example:")

---

## NERDTree (File Browser)
The NERDTree plugin provides a file browser for any files. `<double-click>` or hit `<enter>` on any file to open it in a new buffer. `<single-click>` or hit `<enter>` on any directory to expand / collapse it. When a file is opened, it will open in a new buffer. The tabline will be updated to list that file name as well. Use `<Leader><#>` or `<Leader>n` / `<Leader>p` to move between opened buffers.

If you do a `<middle-click>` on a file, then the current edit window will be split horizontally and the new file will be opened in the split.

### Bookmarks
The NERDTree plugin provides a bookmark feature which can provide a quick access to directories of your choice. One downside of this though is it cannot resolve any environment variables in the path name. To help facilitate this, a per-repository specific bookmark file can be generated using a defaults file. This functionality has been added to automatically generate the bookmarks file on sourcing the [`.bashrc`](../.bashrc) script. This is done by using the [`sbin/gen_nerdtree_bookmarks.py`](../sbin/gen_nerdtree_bookmarks.py) script along with a defaults file located at `${HOME}/.default/NERDTreeDefaultBookmarks` file.

To add bookmarks, modify the `.default/NERDTreeDefaultBookmarks` file to include any bookmarks you want to add. The format should be the name of your bookmark (cannot include spaces), then a single space followed by the path to the file. If an environment variable is needed, you can add that in with a `${<env-var>}` type syntax. The path should be an absolute path.

Example:
```
source-directory /home/<user>/project/source
build-directory ${HOME}/build
projects ${GIT_ROOT}/projects
```

This will generate a file at `${GIT_ROOT}/.rc/NERDTreeBookmarks` which will contain the following (assuming your `$GIT_ROOT` is located at `/work/<user>/<repo>`):
```
source-directory /home/<user>/project/source
build-directory /home/<user>/build
projects /work/<user>/<repo>/projects
```

---

## Tagbar (CTag Viewer)
The Tagbar plugin will use ctags to populate a window with any tags from the current file. `<double-click>` or hit `<enter>` on any tag to jump to it. `<single-click>` or move the cursor over any function and the full prototype will be listed below the statusline. When the cursor is over a particular tag, you can open it in a preview window by hitting the `P` (`<shift>p`) key.

### Tagbar Shortcuts
The following shortcuts all work in the Tagbar window.
```
<enter>        - Jump to tag under cursor in the active window
<double-click> - Jump to tag under cursor in the active window
s              - Toggle tag sorting method between file order and name order
x              - Toggle zoom mode (increase the Tagbar window to full screen width or to normal size).
P              - Open the selected tag in the preview window.
```

### Tagbar Cheatsheet Format
Note: there is also a custom ctags definition for `.cheat` files (cheatsheets). This uses the same syntax as described in the [cheatsheet-folding](https://github.com/raven42/dotfiles/tree/master/.vim#cheatsheet-folding) section. An example can be seen here:

```
##### Header 1 #####
### Section 1

### Section 2

--- Unused Section 3

### Section 4

##### Header 2 #####
### Section 5
```

This will render like this for the tagbar window:

![cheatsheet_tagbar_example](../img/cheatsheet_tagbar_example.png?raw=true "Cheatsheet Tagbar Example:")

---

## Lightline
The Lightline plugin will display useful information about the currently opened file. It will display the file, the current function the cursor is located in (in the bottome status line), a list of the open buffers (on the left side of the tabline), and the current working GIT branch (on the right side of the tabline) if available.

---

## GitGutter / Fugitive
The GitGutter and Fugitive plugins integrate with git to display information about the added / modified / removed git hunks in the current file, as well as provide utilities to perform git operations from within VIM.
* Lines that have been added will be highlighted on the left side of the file window with a green left arrow.
* Lines that have been modified will be highlighted on the left side of the file window with a blue left then right arrow.
* Lines that have been deleted will be highlighted on the left side of the file window with a red right arrow (note: the highlight will occur on the line prior to the deletion).
* The git hunk information is available in the top-right of the VIM window to show the added / modified / removed lines of code for the unstaged changes in the active file.
* The git branch will be visible at the top-right of the VIM window next to the hunk information.
* `:Git blame` can be used to view the `git blame <file>` for the active file in a new buffer next to the opened file. This allows for easy viewing of the blame history of the file. You can `<double-click>` the commit hash to jump to the commit log that introduced that change. Use `:q` to close the blame window if needed.
* The `\gu` (`<Leader>gu`) shortcut can be used to undo the changes in the hunk under the cursor.
* The `\gs` (`<Leader>gs`) shortcut can be used to stage the hunk under the cursor. This can be useful to stage only a subset of changes in a file instead of doing a `git add` for the entire file.
* The `\zg` (`<Leader>zg`) shortcut can be used to fold away all code that is not part of the currently modified hunks. This is useful to view all unstaged changes in a given file.

Example: In this example you can see the added / modified / deleted lines as well as the branch information and the git-folding method.

![git_fold example](../img/git\_fold\_example.png?raw=true "GitFold Example:")

Example: In this example, you can see the output from the `:Git blame` command to view the `git blame` history of the file.

![git_blame example](../img/git\_blame\_example.png?raw=true "GitBlame Example:")

---

## NERDCommenter
The NERDCommenter plugin allows for quickly commenting / uncommenting a block of code or lines of code. This is most easily done in `Visual` mode by selecting text with the mouse (with `set mouse=a` in your .vimrc), or by hitting the `v` key and using the cursor to select the desired text. The following key sequences will have various modes of commenting the code.

| Key Sequence | Command | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <Leader>cc | Comment Toggle | This will toggle a comment block. Either inserting the normal comments if not currently commented, or uncomment the block if it is already commented |
| <Leader>cm | Minimal Comment | This will add a single comment start / end at the beginning / end of the selected block. |
| <Leader>ci | Comment Invert | This will invert the commented code. The commented code selected will be uncommented, the uncommented code will be commented. |
| <Leader>cy | Yank Comment | This will yank the selected code putting a copy of that code into the clipboard, and then comment out the selected code. |

## Additional Plugins
To add any additional plugins, you can automatically add / load them by doing the following:

```
cd ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start
githome submodule add <plugin-url>
githome commit -m "Added plugin <plugin>"
```
:warning: **User Config:** After cloning the remote repo, you may want to set a specific username/email for that repository if using a different github server or account.
```
cd <plugin>
git config --local user.name '<user>'
git config --local user.email '<email>'
```
