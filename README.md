:information\_source: **Personal Copy:** If you wish to modify any of the base scripts, it is recommended to fork your own copy of this repo so you can make your own changes.

## Installation
To setup on a new system, use the following commands. This creates an alias called `githome` which is used in place of the regular `git` program. This is done to allow automatically setting the git directory for a bare repository. A bare repsitory is used to avoid having a git path in your home directory which could lead toward accidental `git` commands run from your home directory. This new bare repository will be located at `$HOME/.cfg`. After cloning the repo, because this is a bare repository, a `checkout` is needed to update everything to the latest:
```
git clone --bare <dotfiles-repo.git> $HOME/.cfg
alias githome='git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfg --work-tree=$HOME'
echo ".cfg" >> .gitignore
githome checkout
```


Setup git to not show untracked files in the status output
```
githome config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
```

Once cloned, it may be necessary to initialize / update any submodules for any git repositories that are embedded in the environment.
```
githome submodule init
githome submodule update
```

To update submodules if they are updated:
```
githome submodule update
```

> :warning: **Note:** You may need to remove any existing conflicting files (such as .bashrc) if there is any default file on the system. Either remove or backup these files.

## Bash Configuration
The [.bashrc](.bashrc) file is a generic resource file which defines some basics which should be compatible for any user. This script will reference the following user specific files.
| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| .default/common_rc.sh | This file is included prior to any repository specific resource files. Use this for common aliases and environment setup. |
| .default/repo_rc.sh | This file is used as a template for any new repositories that use the `${GIT_REPO}` environment setup. This file is copied to `${GIT_REPO}/.rc/rc` for user generated repos |
| ${GIT_ROOT}/.rc/rc | If the `${GIT_ROOT}` envinroment variable is set, this will look for and source any resource file located in this path. This can be used to specify repository specific aliases and environment setup. |
| ${GIT_ROOT}/.rc/bld_target.sh | This file is used to define a specific platform to set for the current command shell. See **Build Target** discussion below |
| .default/post_rc | This file is included at the very end of the `.bashrc` file for any thing to be done at the end of the environment setup. |

## Environment Variables
There are a few environmental configuration options which can be toggled in a user private `.default/common_rc.sh` script.
```
#!/bin/bash

# Default resource file
#
# .default/common_rc.sh -	Set user specific environment options. This should include any aliases, environment path
#							variables, and any other user specific environment options.
#
# This file is sourced in the .bashrc script after defaults have been initialized but before any processing of the env
# variables or execution of supporting scripts This allows the user to override some defaults, or setup other parameters
# prior to executing further env setup scripts. This can be used in conjunction with the .default/post_rc.sh script to
# control and override environment default set in the .bashrc script on a per user basis in the event .bashrc is a common
# file.
#
# The general order of loading resource scripts is as follows:
#	.bashrc
#		// setup any bash environment and other variables
#		// initialize any common ENV vars (PATH / LD_RUN_PATH / etc)
#		// determine env specific resource script based on GIT_REPO
#		. .default/common_rc.sh		# load common_rc.sh script to set any user specific env variables
#		. ${GIT_REPO}/.rc/rc		# load env specific resource script
#		// process any ENV variables needed
#		// setup prompt / title routines
#		. .default/post_rc.sh		# load post_rc.sh script to override anything that was done so far

# To disable unicode characters in VIM and bash prompts. There are unicode characters used for the terminal window title,
# and in VIM, unicode characters are used in the status line, buffer line, and window title.
export USE_UNICODE=1

# Setting this to 0 will not show the current $BLD_TARGET in the command prompt. By default the prompt will look like this:
#   $BLD_TARGET $GIT_REPO (<git-branch>) <directory>$ 
# Setting this to 0 will result in the following:
#   $GIT_REPO (<git-branch>) <directory>$
export SHOW_TARGET_IN_PROMPT=1

# This env variable is used by the .vimrc to shorten path names for window title
# Example: SRC_PATH_PREFIX="common/path/to/src" will result in truncating that
# portion out of the window path title. So if for example you were in the path
#     /<repo>/common/path/to/src/lib/
# then the window title would show
#     /<repo>/../lib/
export SRC_PATH_PREFIX="vobs/projects/springboard"

# UNIFIED_HISTORY - This env var is used to determine if a unified history should be used between all sessions into a host.
# This will enable the 'history' command to use a file instead of in memory history so the shell history is updated every
# command across all sessions, not just the current session as is the default
export UNIFIED_HISTORY=1
```

### GIT REPO Setup
There is a script at `sbin/git-repo` which can be used to setup a new sub-shell environment to set repository specific environment variables and other such parameters. This script will set a few env variables and enter a new sub-shell with these variables defined. It can also be used to clone a new repository if needed. To use this script properly, there are a few key environment variables which should be set in `.default/common_rc`. These variables are as follows:
```
# WORKSPACES - This is a `:` delimited list of paths to search for repositories in. When used with the git-repo script, these paths
# will be searched for any repo name specified on the command line
export WORKSPACES=${HOME}/projects:/public/${USER}/projects

# DEFAULT_GIT_SERVER - This is used to set a URL to a git server from which to clone
export DEFAULT_GIT_SERVER=git@github.com

# DEFAULT_GIT_REPO - This is used to specify a default repository to clone from the server
export DEFAULT_GIT_REPO=raven42/dotfiles.git
```

### Build Target
The `${GIT_ROOT}/.rc/bld_target.sh` file is sourced after every command as part of the `PROMPT_COMMAND` function call. This can be used to set a current `$BLD_TARGET` environment variable which can be used for all future commands. This variable is also displayed on the bash prompt. This can be used to create common aliases / scripts using this environement variable. This build target can be modified using the following script.
```
some_target <git-repo> (master) proj$ bld-target
Current build target is BLD_TARGET=some_target
some_target <git-repo> (master) proj$ bld-target another_target
Set new default BLD_TARGET=another_target in [<git-repo>/.rc/bld_target.sh]
another_target <git-repo> (master) proj$
```

This file should contain as little as possible. Ideally only exporting the $BLD_TARGET environment variable.
```
export BLD_TARGET=<build-target>
```

Example:
`alias cp-img='cp ${GIT_ROOT}/<build-path>/${BLD_TARGET}/<path-to-image> <dest-path>'`

## VIM Usage / Setup
See the [.vim/](.vim/) file for more information on the VIM setup and configuration.

### VIM Compilation
The VIM plugins and resource files all require VIM 8 installed. This can be compiled and installed from the source.
```
git clone https://github.com/vim/vim
cd vim
./configure --prefix=${HOME} --enable-python3interp --enable-perlinterp --enable-gnome-check --enable-gui=auto --enable-gtk2-check --with-x --enable-fontset --enable-gtk2-check
make
make install
```

### VIM Clipboard Setup
By default VIM uses its own clipboard. The [.vimrc](.vimrc) file does override this and uses the system clipboard for autoselect as well as copy/paste funcitonality. If you wish to enabled this for use across SSH connections, then X11 forwarding must be enabled on the SSH session. This can be done in one of two ways.

Enable X11 forwarding per ssh session: This will enable X11 forwarding only for this specific session.
```
ssh -XY <hostname>
```

Enable X11 forwarding in the `.ssh/config` file: This will enable it for SSH connections as defined in the config file.
```
Host *.<trusted-network>
    ForwardX11 yes
    ForwardX11Trusted yes
```

> :warning: **Caution:** Only enable this for trusted hosts. Otherwise this will forward X11 parameters to all hosts.
>
> :warning: **Note:** Also special handling is needed when using visual mode selection. This is set to automatically copy to the system clipboard. If you select something using the mouse, and then while it is still selected use the scroll wheel to move the window down, additional content will be put in the clipboard other than just what was selected.

## Univeral CTAGS
These plugins also work better with Universal CTAGS instead of Exuberant CTAGS. This can also be compiled and installed from the source.
```
git clone https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags
cd ctags
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=${HOME}
make
make install
```
